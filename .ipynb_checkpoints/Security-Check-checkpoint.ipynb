When I decided to retire in the Philippines I never realized what a great idea is was.  Myra is the hardest working and the most dedicated person to my well being, I have ever met in my life. I will be slowly reworking/mastering and re-posting many of my videos to her YouTube. IF the big word is IF I can do it and not offend YouTube's policies. \\n\\nI have been busy, not lazy. Linux has taken me over. I have a virtual box on my computer and can run several types of Linux, windows and even a Java Machine. I am playing with Android SDK and  Ubuntu SDK.  I have had several projects I have mention in the past I wanted to do. The reality of the fact I am not a kid anymore has prompted me to try and finish a few projects I had intended on pursuing.  I write very little other than, tech stuff in the form of private notes. That was one reason I came over to the Philippines was to at least \\\"hobby\\\" write. I also want to develop a couple of phone apps, again just for fun. Life is good. \\n\\nI have blog http://Jacknorthrup.com/blog . It has some pictures to complement many of the videos, sometimes extended articles and some videos not publicly released on YouTube. If you enjoy our YouTube Channel I am quite sure you will enjoy the blog. \\nThank You and Stop on by and say Hello. \\nJack Northrup and Myra Reyes\\n\\n\\nMy retirement in the Philippines began in Sept 6, 2012. I filled a backpack with drawing/art material to write and headed overseas to live a dream. I play and make videos of my life in the Philippines. My life overseas has been the adventure of my lifetime. This Vlog of life here is for my memories and show my friends and family back in the USA the Filipino lifestyle and show the world the joy of overseas retirement..\\n...\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6jTfl9iaSs\",\n",

You will find no novels, no kids books, no books on computer science or hobbies, in fact Philippine history is the main topic of almost all publications. Books are read on site and not checked out. I am a library person and often hung out in the library in the USA. I lived near a University and had access to two GIANT libraries. We had computer access and books on any imaginable topic. Of all things in the USA the library I miss the most.\\n\\nWhen I told Myra about the libraries in the USA it was almost unbelievable to her. \\\"Take books home ?,\\\" she said. \\\"Science fiction books, books on cooking and computers and even art books WOW !\\\"  Would they even have books on how to make marbled paper? REALLY ?\\n\\nSome things in the USA we really take for granted. US tax dollars bring us a lot more in the USA than we realize. Libraries is one small example. I can not imagine my daughter not having a USA library to visit.\\n\\nManila I have been told does have many different topics in the public library. However books can not be \\\"checked out' All reading is done on site. Almost no Small towns do not have any type of library at all. The only exception is a few of the private schools that have an extremely small library for students.\\n...\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5C0h4ER-rE0\",\n",

I wanted to video it being built but there was no one here of authority to authorize it. Much to late I discovered it would have been fine to do all along.\\n\\nI have blog http://Jacknorthrup.com/blog .

I am playing in the Philippines for the rest of my life, so my channel is dedicated to life and fun in the Philippines. My videos range from immigration information to and views on different cultural aspects of life here to our home craft projects and playing in the street. I love making the videos and do it in an entertaining manner when appropriate. My Filipino wife is joining in the videos and has changed from an extremely shy person that would not speak, to a person that enjoys the videos and teases subscribers. Everyone seems to enjoy her and tease back. We both enjoy crafts and I showed Myra how to make Marbled paper. Making the paper and items with the paper has become her main subject of play as well as work.  I am extremely active online notice my website activities below.
