# LBRY-toolbox
Some tools I use on LBRY to get and post content. They are in the form of Bash and Python scripts. Also group of Jupyter notebooks used to create the scripts. Enjoy and subscribe to LBRY.

### Script to get the size of the LBRY blobfiles directory
  *blobfilesize*
### Plays the last file entered in a directory with vlc
  *watchVID.py*
### This script runs the command `lbrynet wallet balance`
  *wallet*
The script directs / appends the json result into a file called`wallet.balance`. 
wallet.balance will be used to create plots' This file once made executable may be copied
into /usr/bin and run as a cron job.
